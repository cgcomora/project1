# Overview

The data being explored comes from the data.gov website and can be found here <https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/bicycle-crashes>.  It contains police-reported information concering motor-vehicle crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists in the Chapel Hill region of North Carolina.  
This data is in the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. JSON is used for storing and transporting data and "is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page."  (<https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp>).  

A JSON file can be confusing to look at, but can be viewed in an application such as notepad.  Here is a look at our "bicycle-crashes" data as it appears when viewed in notepad:

```{r graphics, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/W447075/Documents/json_ex.png")
```

What we see is a lot of name/value pairs, examples of which are highlighted in yellow.  The first example shows the name "ambulancer" with a value of "Yes" and the second shows the sex of the bike rider to be male.  

The total dataset contains 330 observations of 48 variables.  
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#load libraries and load google key for google maps API
library(dplyr)
library(jsonlite)
library(kableExtra)
library(DT)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggmap)
register_google(key = "AIzaSyDlrsQQNa2bElzXnHyPhak28M4HMeZAunE")
```

# Import data

Our first step is to read in our data using the fromJson() function from the package "jsonlite."  The jsonlite package allows us to convert between JSON and R without any loss of data.  I chose this package because I thought it would convert directly to a dataframe but it turned out to be more complicated than that!  <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/vignettes/json-aaquickstart.html>


```{r json, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
#convert from JSON data to R object (dataframe)
json <- fromJSON("bicycle.json")
#simplify by applying unlist() to the dataframe
my_json <- lapply(json,unlist)
#bind rows back together in matrix format
bicycle <- do.call("rbind", my_json)
#convert back to dataframe and transpose
bicycle_df <- as.data.frame(bicycle)
bicycle_df_trans <- t(bicycle_df)
my_tibble <- tbl_df(bicycle_df_trans)
#convert to html friencly datatable w/ no rownames
my_table <- datatable(bicycle_df_trans,rownames = FALSE,caption = "Table of bicycle crash data")
my_table
```

# Analysis

We start with plotting the location of the crashes using the ggmap() function.  This may help inform our data analysis.  For example, why might the crashes be clustered in a certain location? 

```{r map, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
#separate geo coordinates into 2 separate vectors
lat <- my_json$geo_point_2d[1:165]
long <- my_json$geo_point_2d[166:330]
#join vectors together in a matrix and coerce to dataframe
coord <- cbind(lat,long)
coord <- matrix(coord, ncol = 2)
coord_df <- as.data.frame(coord)
#plot map and overlay points representing crashes
p <- ggmap(ggmap = get_map(center = c(lat = 35.9, lon = -79.050),zoom = 12)) + geom_point(data = coord_df,aes(coord_df$V2,coord_df$V1),col="red")
p
```

Now we will use contingency tables to look at the frequency distribution of several variables. (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_table>)

```{r cont_tables, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
#create 1st contingency table
ctab1 <- table(my_tibble$crsh_sevri,my_tibble$drvr_sex)
ctab1 <-kable_styling(kable(ctab1,caption = "Contingency table showing severity of crash and sex of bicyclist"))
ctab1
#create 2nd contingency table
ctab2 <- table(my_tibble$bike_race, dnn = "Race")
ctab2 <- kable_styling(kable(ctab2, caption = "Contingency table showing frequency of crashes by race of bicyclist"))
ctab2
#create 3rd contingency table
ctab3 <- table(my_tibble$crash_mont,dnn = "Month")
ctab3 <- kable_styling(kable(ctab3, caption = "Contingency table showing frequency of crashes by month"))
ctab3
```
To group the age of the bicyclists involved in crashes into categories, we create a new variable called "age_group".

```{r, newvar, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
my_tibble$age_group = ifelse(my_tibble$bike_age >18, "Adult", ifelse(my_tibble$bike_age<=18,"Youth","Unknown"))
ctab4 <- table(my_tibble$age_group, dnn = "Age_Group")
ctab4 <- kable_styling(kable(ctab4, caption = "Contingency table showing frequency of crashes by Age Group"))
ctab4
```
Now lets look at some plots to further explore what relationships might exist between variables.  

```{r plot1, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
#create bar plot
g <- ggplot(my_tibble, aes(x = crsh_sevri))
g + geom_bar(aes(fill=rd_conditi)) + labs(x="Crash Severity", title = "Barplot of crash severity and road condition") + theme(legend.title = element_blank())+ scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Disabling Injury", "Evident Injury", "Possible Injury", "Killed", "No Injury"))
#coerce char var's to numeric
driver_age <- as.numeric(my_tibble$drvr_age)
bike_age <- as.numeric(my_tibble$bike_age)
g2 <- ggplot(my_tibble, aes(x = factor(1))) + geom_boxplot(width = 0.4,aes(y = driver_age), fill = "blue") + facet_wrap(~crashalcoh) + labs(title = "Driver age for crashes involving and not involving alcohol", x = "") 
g2
#create scatter plot
g + geom_point(aes(y = bike_age, col = bike_sex)) + scale_y_discrete(breaks  = c(10,20,30,40,50,60,70)) + scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Disabling Injury", "Evident Injury", "Possible Injury", "Killed", "No Injury")) + labs(title = "Biker age and crash severity according to sex",x = "Crash Severity", y = "Biker age")
```

Next, let's create a function to look at center and spread of age of bicyclists involved in crashes.

```{r function, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
my_summary <- function(x){
  mean <- mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  stdev <- sd(x, na.rm = TRUE)
return(list(mean,stdev))
}
my_tibble$bike_age <- as.numeric(my_tibble$bike_age)
my_summary <- my_summary(my_tibble$bike_age)
my_summary_nolist <- unlist(my_summary)
summary_matrix <- matrix(my_summary_nolist,ncol = 2)
colnames(summary_matrix) <- c("Mean","Std dev")
summary_matrix
```

After conducting this initial exploratory data analysis, there are several relationships that could be explored further.  For example, we could hypothesize that car accidents involving bicycles are more likely to happen in certain locations.  We could also explore whether or not there is a particular combination of factors such as time of year, road condition, age group, and alcohol that could be used to model how likely it is that a fatal crash will occur.
